Practical rule of thumb (use this in design reviews)

If it must be correct, put it in a microservice

If it must be interpreted, use an agent

If it must be orchestrated, use LangGraph

If it must be auditable and enforceable, never leave it to an agent alone

One sentence that usually clicks

A microservice enforces reality.
An agent reasons about reality.
